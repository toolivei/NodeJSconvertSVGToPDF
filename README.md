# NodeJSconvertSVGToPDF
API for converting from SVG to PDF format!

The data for conversion is sent in base64 format and also received in base64 format.

To convert the SVG file, we need to convert the file to base64 and call the conversion API. The API will return the data in base64 format, after that we need to convert it to its original format to save the PDF file.
